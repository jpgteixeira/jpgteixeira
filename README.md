## Hi there, I am João Paulo 👋

I’m a biologist with a Master’s degree in Animal Biology, an educator with a degree in Pedagogy, and a tenured public school teacher in the Espírito Santo State education system (Brazil), currently on official study leave to pursue a PhD.

I’ve worked as:
- Fauna Rescue Biologist / Ornithologist  
- School Principal  
- Administrative Advisor at a Regional Education Office  

Currently, I’m pursuing:
- A degree in Internet Systems Technology  
- A PhD in Genetics and Plant Breeding  

My academic path reflects a strong interest in connecting **science, education, and technology**, driven by a deep admiration for complex natural systems.

**Interests:** Ecology, Genetics, Statistics, and GIS. I’m also open to new challenges and enjoy learning new tools.
